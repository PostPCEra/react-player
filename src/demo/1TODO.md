### debug - 2

### debug - 1
 - with App2.js  it works and webpage displays player , every thing works
 - with RTabelApp.js , no build errors, but won't display web page
 - so Try doing RtableApp.js as stand alone React app and try to dispay Table page ...
 - if that works, then we see why  it won't work along with  React-player App.js  ...
